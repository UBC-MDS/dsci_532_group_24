2. Description of the data

We will visualize the annual estimates of child mortality (deaths of children aged 0 - 5 years) for different countries, as well as a closer look into some preventable causes of child mortality. Dataset for total number of child deaths, as well as individual datasets for specific causes of child deaths (e.g. HIV deaths, malaria deaths, measles deaths, and meningitis deaths) are available separately through [Gapminder website](www.gapminder.org/data).

Dataset for total number of child deaths contains observations from 194 countries (arranged into rows in alphabetical order) over 216-year period from 1800 – 2015, inclusive, (arranged into columns in chronological order). Dataset for each cause of child mortality contains observations from 188 countries over 27-year period from 1990 – 2016, inclusive.  Of this dataset, we will focus on observations from countries in the African continent from 1990 – 2015, inclusive. It may help to note that even though the observations are childhood mortality reported in total number of cases for the given year, many observations are not whole numbers, as they are estimated figures.

Information on how the child mortality data are collected is available on [Gapminder summary documentation](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd005/).

The method of approximation for annual estimates of childhood mortality is described in a [2013 report by WHO](https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/ChildCME_method.pdf).
