## Motivation and Purpose

The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the inequality in access to healthcare among nations, ethnicities and classes. Although sufferings in wealthy and powerful nations have occupied the headlines, Africa as a continent requires more attention and resources.  According to the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/reducing-child-mortality-challenges-africa), sub-Saharan Africa alone accounts for almost 50 per cent of child mortality, although it constitutes only 11 per cent of the world population. Moreover, some of the least developed countries still have very high infant and child death rates. For example, in 2019, 86 out of 1000 newborns in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, a nation with 86.79 million people, do not make it to their fifth birthday. In Chad, the number is as high as 117. By contrast, about 99.6% (996 in 1000) of Canadian newborns are still alive when they are five years old. As internal data analysts for an international non-governmental organization (INGO), we are dedicated to using data to understand infant and child mortality on the ground across the African continent. 

We will explore, analyze and present the diseases behind infant and child death in Africa, and produce a data dashboard for internal use. We believe that our work will inform our organization's leadership on where in Africa we should pour our resources to, and what disease-specific measures, e.g. medications and vaccines, we should focus on in different countries. Specifically, we aim to understand the following questions: 

 - Which countries in Africa have the most severe infant and child death problem? How does each country's situation changes over time?
 - Among major diseases, what are the main causes of infant and child mortality? How does the severity of each cause change over time?

Furthermore, we also expect the dashboard to be published for a larger audience of donors, government partners and receiver countries. Users of our data dashboard will be able to select the country, year or disease type that they are interested in. This will help them make informed and targeted decisions. 


## Description of the data

We will visualize the annual estimates of child mortality (deaths of children aged 0 - 5 years) for different countries, as well as a closer look into some preventable causes of child mortality. Dataset for total number of child deaths, as well as individual datasets for specific causes of child deaths (e.g. HIV deaths, malaria deaths, measles deaths, and meningitis deaths) are available separately through [Gapminder website](www.gapminder.org/data).

Dataset for total number of child deaths contains observations from 194 countries (arranged into rows in alphabetical order) over 216-year period from 1800 – 2015, inclusive, (arranged into columns in chronological order). Dataset for each cause of child mortality contains observations from 188 countries over 27-year period from 1990 – 2016, inclusive.  Of this dataset, we will focus on observations from countries in the African continent from 1990 – 2015, inclusive. It may help to note that even though the observations are childhood mortality reported in total number of cases for the given year, many observations are not whole numbers, as they are estimated figures.

Information on how the child mortality data are collected is available on [Gapminder summary documentation](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd005/).

The method of approximation for annual estimates of childhood mortality is described in a [2013 report by WHO](https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/ChildCME_method.pdf).
